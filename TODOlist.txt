Things that I want to add next:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Make a new button on each bubble that will let you edit it's description

*Might make a new screen or window that shows up when you edit a description so its easier to see

*Make the description of a bubble fit in the oval, not a rectangle

*Make new layout presets other than just top down file list, these are listed in the displayLogic folder with TODOs to explain them more

*Fill out the list of language JSONs and PNGs

*Add more languages to the JSON list

*Add more LSP alternatives for languages to offload work from the AI

*Apply the theme randomizer / creator and add it to Settings (randomizer should be completed)

*Use AI to do the other 3 Proompt file ideas

*Auto LSP link downloader for languages you dont have it for

*Sort Function bubbles and have them point to their respective Line numbers. They can be alternating colors or something.

*Make Bubbles and FunctionBubbles have an option to edit their description

*Make Code Bubbles have an option to edit their code (might be dangerous or unsafe for now)

I want this project to stay free and easy to use forever, which means I dont want this to cost me much or anything at
all for other people to run.
