Things that I want to add next:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Make a new button on each bubble that will let you edit it's description

*Might make a new screen or window that shows up when you edit a description so its easier to see

*Make the description of a bubble fit in the oval, not a rectangle

*Make new layout presets other than just top down file list, these are listed in the displayLogic folder with TODOs to explain them more

*Fill out the list of language JSONs and PNGs

*Add more languages to the JSON list

*Apply the theme randomizer / creator and add it to Settings (randomizer should be completed)

*start working on the universal parser to split the code into functions and / or more digestible parts (PROGRESS)

*EVENTUALLY IN THE FUTURE learn how to incorporate AI to generate descriptions for each thing. the proompts folder in resources explains this more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want this project to stay free and easy to use forever, which means I dont want this to cost me much or anything at all for people to run. This means
I am not paying for an AI server, so either I need to learn more about local lightweight AI that fits on a PC, or API calls to one of thats even possible.
