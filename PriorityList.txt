Things that I want to add next:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Finish working on making the TopBubble display the language bar correctly (currently broken)

*Make a new button on each bubble that will let you edit it's description

*Might make a new screen or window that shows up when you edit a description so its easier to see

*Make the description of a bubble fit in the oval, not a rectangle

*Make new layout presets other than just top down file list, these are listed in the displayLogic folder with TODOs to explain them more

*Fill out the list of language JSONs and PNGs

*Add more languages to the JSON list

*Apply the theme randomizer / creator and add it to Settings (randomizer should be completed)

*EVENTUALLY start working on a way to get all of the functions of the program, add it to the initial progress bar loader that creates the project, and
have it add all the functions as their own bubbles, and each function bubble should be able to see the fields of that class.

*EVENTUALLY IN THE FUTURE learn how to incorporate AI to generate descriptions for each thing. the proompts folder in resources explains this more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want this project to stay free and easy to use forever, which means I dont want this to cost me much or anything at all for people to run. This means
I am not paying for an AI server, so either I need to learn more about local lightweight AI that fits on a PC, or API calls to one of thats even possible.
