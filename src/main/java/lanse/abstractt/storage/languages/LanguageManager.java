    //TODO - Things to list for the language:
    // What is a Comment (list) ((for example, java has // and /* and /** and */))
    // What is a function
    // What is the default Main of the project (can be set by user though)
    // What is it's Icon
    // Exceptions or things to note. For example: SAS uses input cards; ; for Data, and that could probably be represented as
    // bubble instead of ignored.
    // Whether to store the language as a JSON or a Class. (Dont worry too much about this, but if it has a lot of exceptions
    // or stuff that make it harder, then it might need to use code to run. For example, Javascript's function is simply function,
    // while java is a regex of () {}
